# Salary-Analysis
This project analyses employee data to evaluate salary fairness at a firm (Technova). Using datasets on employee details, education, and salary components, it identifies factors that most influence pay and detects potential inequities.

A predictive model was developed to explain salary variations through regression and feature importance analysis. The results informed recommendations for fair, data-driven compensation policies. All Python code is clearly commented for future analysts.

#Note: Data was chosen so that MAPE cannot be lower than 25%
